# LEA-256 Implementation (Java, JavaScript, and C)

## Development Period
2022-05-17 ~ 2022-06-02

## Introduction
This project implements LEA-256 in Java, JavaScript, and C languages. 
LEA-256 is a symmetric key block cipher algorithm developed by the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA).

## Usage
In the main function of each file, encryption and decryption are performed for the LEA-256 test vectors. The decrypted value is then checked to ensure that it matches the original message. The test vectors are as follows:
```
KEY = 0f 1e 2d 3c 4b 5a 69 78 87 96 a5 b4 c3 d2 e1 f0 f0 e1 d2 c3 b4 a5 96 87 78 69 5a 4b 3c 2d 1e 0f
Plaintext = 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3a 3b 3c 3d 3e 3f
```

Please refer to the code for further details.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the respective language directory.
3. Compile the code.
4. Run the executable file and verify the output.
